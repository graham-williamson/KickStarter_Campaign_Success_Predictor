# Predictions of the Outcome of Kickstarter Campaigns

Kickstarter is a crowdfunding platform with a community of more than 10 million people comprising of creative, tech enthusiasts who help in bringing new projects to life.

Until now, more than $3 billion dollars have been contributed by the members in fueling creative projects. The projects can be literally anything – a device, a game, an app, a film etc.

Kickstarter works on all or nothing basis: a campaign is launched with a certain amount they want to raise, if it doesn’t meet its goal, the project owner gets nothing. For example: if a projects’s goal is \$5000, even if it gets funded till $4999, the project won’t be a success.

The aim of this mini-project is to use readily available data to see whether, and with what accuracy, I can predict whether a project being posted on Kickstarter now will be successfully funded or not?
